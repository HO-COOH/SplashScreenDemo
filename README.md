# SplashScreenDemo (WIP)
This is a demo project to show how to create a perfect splashscreen for a winui3 app (in my opinion).

A good splashscreen should be somewhat similar to UWP's implementation, that ideally achieve:
- Fast to startup
- Seamless transition to the main window (if exist)
- Ideally use as little resource as possible
